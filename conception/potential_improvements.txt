POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS

-> Direct chat within the application instead of email.
-> Adding images to profiles.
-> Access to a detailed profile view.
-> The ability to create project presentations that users can swipe through and request to join.
-> (Instead of emailing, this could become an invitation to participate in the project. If the profile accepts, participants could then chat within the project).
-> Adding a premium subscription system (e.g., for greater visibility).
